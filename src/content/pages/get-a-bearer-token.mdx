title: "How to Get a Bearer Token"
description: ""
---

Bearer tokens, also known as access tokens or JSON web tokens, authorize use of the Beneficiary Claims Data API (BCDA) endpoints. You will need a bearer token to [access claims data](/access-claims-data.html) in the sandbox and production environments.

## Instructions


### 1. Get your organization's credentials

BCDA protects its token endpoint with Basic Auth. Your credentials will be formatted as a client ID and client secret.
- If you're trying to access the **sandbox environment:** Use a sample client ID and secret from the [sandbox credentials section](/get-a-bearer-token.html#sandbox-credentials).
- If you're trying to access the **production environment:** Use the client ID and secret issued by your model-specific system during [production access](/production-access.html).

### 2. Request a bearer token

Start a request in your terminal window or using a tool like Postman.

#### Request to retrieve a token

<CopySnippet
    lang="shell"
    code={`POST /auth/token`}
/>

#### Request header

The header has “Authorization: Basic” followed by the credentials. Credentials (clientID:secret) are joined by a colon, then encoded in Base64 format.

 <CopySnippet
    lang="shell"
    code={`Authorization: Basic {base64_encoded_credentials}
Accept: application/json`}
/>

#### Example curl command to request a bearer token

In this example, the authorization in the request header is replaced with `--user {client ID}:{client secret}` 

This command uses curl's built-in ability to Base-64 encode your credentials, request, and receive your token in a single step.

 <CopySnippet
    lang="shell"
    code={`curl -d "" -X POST "https://sandbox.bcda.cms.gov/auth/token" \\
    --user {client ID}:{client secret} \\
    -H "Accept: application/json"`}
/>

<Alert heading="Remember to use the correct URL for your environment">
Use sandbox.bcda.cms.gov to access the sandbox or api.bcda.cms.gov to access the production environment.
</Alert>

#### Response example: successful request

If your request succeeds, you'll receive a 200 response with your bearer token in the response body. It'll be the full text string that follows “access_token”. The token string below has been abbreviated for readability.

“Expires_in” counts down the seconds remaining before the token expires, which is 20 minutes after it is generated. “Token_type: Bearer” is a fixed value.

<CopySnippet
    lang="shell"
    code={`{
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR...", 
    "expires_in": "1200",
    "token_type":"bearer"
}`}
/>
### 3. Set your bearer token in your request headers

Include your bearer token in the authorization header when requesting data in the sandbox and production environments. “Bearer” must be included in the header with a capital B and followed by a space.

<CopySnippet
    lang="shell"
    code={`Authorization: Bearer {bearer_token}`}
/>

Now you can begin [accessing claims data](/access-claims-data.html). The production and sandbox environments support the same workflow, endpoints, and resource types.  

## Sandbox credentials

Sandbox credentials allow anyone to access test claims data. These credentials will not work in the production environment. 

Sample data sets vary in size and data complexity, ranging from 50 to 30,000 synthetic enrollees, to best match the needs of your model entity.  

### Adjudicated claims data sets - 5 simple sizes
Use the data sets to test retrieving and downloading data files into your internal ingestion processes. However, the test data may not reflect an accurate distribution of disease and demographic information.

#### Extra-small model entity (50 synthetic enrollees)

Client ID:

    lang="shell"
    code={`2462c96b-6427-4efb-aed7-118e20c2e997`}

Client secret:

/>

#### Extra-large model entity (30,000 synthetic enrollees)

Client ID:

<CopySnippet
    lang="shell"
    code={`aa2d6b93-bbe7-4d1b-8cc5-9a5172fae3a6`}

Client secret:

/>

### Adjudicated claims data sets – 2 advanced sizes

Advanced data sets offer a more accurate representation with the bulk FHIR format and a realistic distribution of disease and demographic information. 

The small data set helps you understand the format of BCDA data. The large data set is better for in-depth exploration or early load testing of your systems.

#### Extra-small model entity (100 synthetic enrollees)

Client ID:

### Partially adjudicated claims data sets 

Anyone can access [partially adjudicated claims data](/partially-adjudicated-claims-data.html) in the sandbox. Only REACH ACOs can access enrollees' partially adjudicated claims data during production. 

#### Extra-small REACH ACO (110 synthetic enrollees)
