## Calling the API

This section provides information on basic and common queries against the Blue Button API.  For a complete listing of Blue Button API calls, see our [Swagger documentation](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/docs/openapi){:target="_blank"}.


### Base FHIR URLs

| Environment | Purpose | Base URL |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Sandbox     | Development and Testing     | `https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v2/fhir/`   |
| Production | Production Data Access | `https://api.bluebutton.cms.gov/v2/fhir/`|
{:.ds-c-table}

    
To find enrollees with varying volumes and types of data, use this [CSV of synthetic data](/synthetic_users_by_claim_count_full.csv). Using the synthetic data, you can break down claims by type (carrier, inpatient, etc.) for each enrollee/user combination.  Synthetic data works in both the Sandbox and Production environments.
	


### Querying Resources
A listing of common API calls are shown in the table below.  See "Base FHIR URLs" above and substitute for {baseURL} as appropriate.

| Resource | Request | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Patient     | `HTTP GET {baseURL}/Patient`     | Returns a [bundle](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html){:target="_blank"} of [Patient resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html){:target="_blank"} with one entry (one patient resource).  You can use the resource ID `Bundle.entry.resource.id`in later queries.  For synthetic data, the ID is a negative number.     |
| Patient | `HTTP GET {baseURL}/Patient/{id}` | Returns a single Patient resource.  Replace `{id}` with a valid patient resource ID.  See `/Patient` call above. |
| Coverage | `HTTP GET {baseURL}/Coverage?beneficiary={ id }`<br>OR<br>`HTTP GET {baseURL}/Coverage`| Replace `{id}` with the patient resource ID.  Returns a [bundle](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html){:target="_blank"} of [Coverage resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/coverage.html){:target="_blank"} |
| Explanation of Benefit |  `HTTP GET {baseURL}/ExplanationOfBenefit?patient={ id }`<br />OR<br />`HTTP GET {baseURL}/ExplanationOfBenefit`| Replace `{id}` with patient resource ID.  Returns a [bundle](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html){:target="_blank"} of [Explanation of Benefit resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/explanationofbenefit.html){:target="_blank"}.  The bundle should contain one or more EOBs. You can use the resource ID located at `Bundle.entry.resource.id` (the explanation of benefit resource ID) in later queries.  For synthetic data, the ID is typically formatted as `[claimtype]`â€“`[number]` Example: `carrier--10114937820` |
| Explanation of Benefit  | `HTTP GET {baseURL}/ExplanationOfBenefit/{id}` | Returns a single [Explanation of Benefit resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/explanationofbenefit.html){:target="_blank"}.  Replace {id} with a valid EOB resource ID.  See `/ExplanationOfBenefit` call above. |
| Capability Statement | `HTTP GET {baseURL}/metadata` | Returns the [FHIR capability statement](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement.html){:target="_blank"} (Example: the FHIR features and operations supported by this server) |
| User Info | `HTTP GET {host}/{version}/connect/userinfo` | If the user grants access to access to their personal information, `UserInfo` returns name, family name and email. If the user denies access to their personal information, `UserInfo` returns `You do not have permission.` |
