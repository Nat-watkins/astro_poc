## Getting started in the developer sandbox

To get started integrating with the Blue Button 2.0 API, you'll need to register a sandbox application. You don't need a working application at this point, but you need to define basic settings to generate client credentials for testing purposes.   

### 1\. Register an application in the developer sandbox

1. Go to the [Sandbox Dashboard](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/home). (If you don't already have an account, create one.)
2. Click [Add an Application](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v2/o/applications/register/).

### 2\. Enter application details

When you add or edit a sandbox application, you'll enter various required configuration details.

#### Application Name

The name of your sandbox application. 

#### OAuth Client Type

The Blue Button 2.0 API only supports confidential client type. 

#### Authorization Grant Type 

The Blue Button 2.0 API only supports the authorization code grant type. An authorization code is a random string generated by the authorization server and returned to the application as part of the authorization response.

#### Callback URLs / Redirect URIs 

This is an API endpoint on your system that receives the callback after a user successfully authorizes your application to access their Medicare data. To enter multiple URIs in the **Callback URLs / Redirect URIs** field, separate each entry with a space or new line.   

Sample format: `URIscheme://[sub-domain.]domain_name[:port]/path`

#### Does my application need to collect enrollee demographic data?

This setting determines 2 things:

* What [scopes](#scopes) are applied to your application (determines which API calls your application can execute).
* The information and options displayed on the authorization screen Medicare enrollees use to allow or deny your application access to their data.

| **Setting** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

To learn more about scopes and permissions, visit [Authorization](#authorization).

### 3\. Save your application

Click **Save Application**.  

After you register your sandbox application, you'll get a Client ID and Client Secret.

* Client ID: an alphanumeric string used to identify your application. Use this in your code when you call the Blue Button 2.0 API.
* Client Secret: an alphanumeric string used by your application to authenticate with the Blue Button server.  

Note: Client credentials from the developer sandbox only work in the sandbox environment. To get production credentials, you need to complete the [production access requirements](#production-api-access) and be approved.  

### 4\. Test the API with Postman or cURL

Once you've created a Blue Button 2.0 sandbox application, you can start making requests. The instructions in this section will get you up and running quickly with Postman or cURL.

#### Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a widely used API client. To start making Blue Button 2.0 API sandbox calls in Postman, follow the steps shown below.  

STEPS REMOVED

#### cURL

You can also call the  Blue Button 2.0 sandbox with [cURL](https://curl.se/), a popular command-line HTTP client.

First, obtain an access token. To test using your sandbox application, you can use [Postman](#postman) to retrieve a token with your client ID and secret, as shown in the previous section. Alternately, you can get a sample authorization token from the Blue Button 2.0 Test Client as shown in the following steps:  

LIST REMOVED

Once you have an access token, you can start making API calls with cURL. For example, the following command will retrieve explanation of benefit information for the authenticated patient (replace `<YOUR ACCESS TOKEN>` with your actual access token):  

~~~
curl --location "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v2/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit/" --header "Accept: application/json" --header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR ACCESS TOKEN>"
~~~
